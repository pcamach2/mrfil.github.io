<p>Wanna write a documentation website for your project… And feeling dull to install and create a lot of pages and configure settings and servers… in (you guessed it) WordPress or some Wiki software?</p>

<p>Let’s mash that all up, I’ve a better and easier solution for you! It just requires you to have… guess what? Some knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS, or may be JavaScript so that you can customize the front-end with what you want!</p>

<p>And interestingly, you’ll have to maintain only the files that really belong of your documentation… What do I mean? Seen those folders… wp-includes, wp-admin… with a lot of functions you don’t know whither they come? Ufff!</p>

<p>If you’re developing a project like… umm… let’s write in bullets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your project - in fact documentation needs lesser features, in fact, just text.</li>
  <li>You’re willing to configure a few things in your code editor.</li>
  <li>You’re happy to write some CSS or shift some HTML classes so that you get a look you want.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="content-subhead" id="whos-algomash-not-for">Who’s Algomash NOT for?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For developers coding a CMS</li>
  <li>For developers coding an OS</li>
  <li>If you want Wiki specific features.</li>
</ul>
